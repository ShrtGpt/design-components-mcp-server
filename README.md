# Design Components MCP Server – QuickFood

A small but polished **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that serves ready‑to‑use UI snippets for a fictional food‑delivery brand, **QuickFood**. 
It includes a responsive navbar, a pill‑shaped primary button, and a confetti CTA that celebrates successful actions.  

This is the **first MCP server I’ve built**, created with guidance from a mentor.
